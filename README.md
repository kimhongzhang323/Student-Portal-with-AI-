## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kimhongzhang323/Student-Portal-with-AI-
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```

3. Install the required packages:

## Environment Variables

To keep sensitive information secure, you will need to set up environment variables.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json` with the actual path to your Firebase service account key file.

3. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed:

   ```plaintext
   # .gitignore
   .env
   ```
