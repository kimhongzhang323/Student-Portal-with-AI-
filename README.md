## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 3.2 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL database
- PostgreSQL account

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kimhongzhang323/Student-Portal-with-AI-
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Navigate to the React frontend directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd frontend  # Assuming the React app is in a directory named 'frontend'
   npm install
   ```

## Environment Variables

To keep sensitive information secure, you will need to set up environment variables.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   DB_NAME='your_db_name'
   DB_USER='your_db_user'
   DB_PASSWORD='your_db_password'
   DB_HOST='localhost'
   DB_PORT='5432'
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

3. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed:

   ```plaintext
   # .gitignore
   .env
   ```

## PostgreSQL Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL on your machine if it's not already installed.
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database for the project:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
   ```

3. Create a user for the database with appropriate permissions:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_db_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_db_name TO your_db_user;
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. Open a new terminal window, navigate to the React frontend directory, and start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` for the React frontend.

## Contributing

2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/YourFeature
   ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your message"
   ```

4. Push to your branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/YourFeature
   ```
